DS-OS
=====

This is a small operating system written in 8086 assembly.
It was written in the late 90's and was not under version
control.

The operating system is in working order has comes complete
with:

* kernel / simple file system / interrupt based API
* command interpreter
* boot loader
* sample user program (hex dumper)
* a PS/2 mouse driver

Work on this project stopped around 1999, but the OS can
still be run today on a PC-compatible machine or under
under a virtual machine such as Virtual Box.  For more
information and some documentation please see the project's
website (which was also created in the late 90's and
resurrected):
