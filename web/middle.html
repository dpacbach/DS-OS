DS-OS is a free operating system with open source written entirely in 8086 assembly using the
<A HREF="http://eji.com/a86">A86</A> assembler.  Note that it is not compatible with any other OS, it was
written and designed from the ground up.

<B>What makes DS-OS unique?</B>
</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
DS-OS is a great way to learn operating systems programming.  It is a full blown operating system,
yet it has just the right amount of functionality and will not overwhelm beginners
<BR><BR>
DS-OS is small(about 6k total), so you don't have to sort through 1000's of
lines of source code to find what you want.  The source code is also heavily
commented, written entirely in 8086 assembly.  It was coded in A86, a very good
8086 assembler, so that anyone can make any changes to it and re-assemble it.
If there is interest I can put this on GitHub.

<B>What can I do with DS-OS?</B>
</FONT></TD></TR></TABLE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
DS-OS comes with a new assembler [2014 Edit: was never finished] called DS-ASM created especially for DS-OS.
It also comes with a text editor [2014 Edit: I can give this to you if you are interested], so you can develope your own assembly programs for it.
You can use any of the DS-OS code in your operating system if you would like(for free), but I would appreciate if you
would let me know if you do so I can download your OS and see it! :)
